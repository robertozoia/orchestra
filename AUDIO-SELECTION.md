- Better for distinguishing similar instruments

### Why A Notes (Where Available)?
- Consistent pitch reference across instruments
- Natural tuning note for orchestra (A440)
- Available across most instrument ranges

### Why 1-Second Duration?
- Long enough to hear timbre
- Short enough for quick rounds
- Good balance for web loading
